                    <h3>What road test bookings can I make through your site?</h3>
                    <p>We can book on your behalf any Ontario road tests, including tests for classes <strong>G, G2, M, M2, A, B, C, D, E, F, and Z.</strong></p>
                    <h3>What does the $40 plus HST fee cover?</h3>
                    <p>The fee we charge covers the costs of running our fast, targeted road test booking service. It is separate from the fee you pay the Ministry of Transportation to take a road test.</p>
                    <h3>Why do I need to secure my booking in advance with PayPal, if you don't charge me until you book one of the dates I requested?</h3>
                    <p>In the past, we requested payment after we secured their road test. Unfortunately, many customers didn't pay.
                        Now, we request that customers secure their booking by authorizing it in PayPal, so that we can get paid when you get booked - and not a moment sooner.
                        When you click the button to secure your booking via PayPal, it looks exactly like a payment - but it's not. You won't see a transaction in your bank account until we book your requested road test. At that point, the PayPal transaction is automatic.</p>
                    <h3>What added value do I get by booking through you?</h3>
                    <p>Our service is designed to save you time otherwise spent searching for a road test appointment. Many road test centres are fully booked for months in advance.</p>
                    <p>Our unique software constantly searches for openings, day and night. We book your appointment the moment a booking that fits your criteria becomes available - for example, when someone else cancels their appointment on a date, time and at a location that you've requested.</p>
                    <p>Booking through us means you won't have to continually revisit drivetest.ca to manually search for convenient bookings. Your chances of getting the road test you want are much higher when you use our service, because some popular road test appointments are booked within minutes of becoming available.</p>
                    <p>And if you need to get your license quickly, our software is the best way to take advantage of last-minute openings.</p>
                    <h3>What if I have already booked a road test through another website, but want to find a more convenient booking through your site?</h3>
                    <p>Our system will search for the booking you've requested. As soon as we find an opening, we'll automatically change your road test and you'll receive confirmation from DriveTest of your new booking.</p>
                    <h3>Will you be able to get the date and location I want?</h3>
                    <p>We can't guarantee that the road test booking you request will become available â€“ especially if you're looking to take a test in the next few days. However, there's also no risk. You'll be fully refunded if we don't find a road test appointment when and where you requested - unlike many other booking services.</p>
                    <p>We realize that most customers don't want to be notified of their appointment at the very last minute. That's why we stop processing your order 24 hours before the last time in your request, if we haven't yet found you a road test booking. For example, if you're looking for an appointment between November 17<sup>th</sup> at 10 a.m. and December 9<sup>th</sup> at 4 p.m., we will stop processing your order on December 8<sup>th</sup> at 4 p.m. if no opening has become available.</p>
                    <h3>When will you notify me of a booking availability?</h3>
                    <p>When you place your order with us, until the time we confirm your appointment, we'll keep you updated with occasional messages letting you know that we're still searching.</p>
                    <p>Once we successfully schedule your appointment, you'll be notified by DriveTest of your appointment details, and we'll send an invoice.</p>
                    <h3>When will I be billed for the service?</h3>
                    <p>You only pay when we find a road test booking that matches your request. Your PayPal transaction will be processed automatically at that time.</p>
                    <h3>How do I pre-pay my Ministry DriveTest road fee before booking here?</h3>
                    <p>There are a variety of ways to book and prepay your Ministry road test fees through DriveTest. Learn more at <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.drivetest.ca/book-a-road-test/payments-cancellations-refunds.html">https://www.drivetest.ca/book-a-road-test/payments-cancellations-refunds.html</a></p>
                    <p>When you book through DriveTest, it's common to find that many centres are booked for months in advance. Most of our customers come to us after booking with drivetest.ca, to find an earlier or more convenient time.</p>
                    <h3>Why do I need to pre-pay my Ministry DriveTest road fee before booking here?</h3>
                    <p>Our technology is designed to reschedule bookings that have been prepaid through the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
                    <p>We help customers who have made an initial road test booking, usually through the DriveTest site, but are unsatisfied with the road test availability. Our system works to find a more convenient date, time and/or location and to reschedule the initial road test booking.</p>
                    <p>We are in no way affiliated with the Ministry or the DriveTest centres.</p>
                    <h3>Can I pay my Ministry of Transportation fee through your site?</h3>
                    <p>You must pay your Ministry of Transportation fee at one of the DriveTest centres, by calling the DriveTest phone line or at drivetest.ca. We do not handle Ministry payments at this time.</p>
                    <h3>What methods of payment do you accept?</h3>
                    <p>We use PayPal to process your payment. You can pay using your PayPal account, with Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express credit cards.</p>
                    <p>To begin the road test booking search process, you must first authorize a payment through PayPal. No transaction will take place until we make your booking.</p>
                    <h3>What if I need to change my booking?</h3>
                    <p>Please email us right away at <a href='mailto:info@bookroadtest.ca'>info@bookroadtest.ca</a> if you need to change your booking request. We'll change your order, with no additional charge.</p>
                    <h3>What if I need to cancel my booking?</h3>
                    <p>Please email us right away at <a href='mailto:info@bookroadtest.ca'>info@bookroadtest.ca</a> if you need to cancel your booking request. We'll cancel your order, and make a full refund.</p>
                    <h3>Are there any charges if I need to cancel the road test I've booked through your site?</h3>
                    <p>We do not charge a fee to cancel or change a booking request that has not yet been fulfilled. You can notify us of your change of plans by emailing <a href='mailto:info@bookroadtest.ca'>info@bookroadtest.ca</a> and, provided no booking has been made, we won't bill you.</p>
                    <p>Once we've booked the road test appointment you requested, we can't offer a refund. You will need to cancel your appointment through your account at drivetest.ca or by calling DriveTest.</p>
                    <p>If you want to find a new appointment quickly and easily, you can make another request through our site. You will be issued a new invoice when we find your new booking.</p>
